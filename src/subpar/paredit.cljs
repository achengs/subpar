;;
;; what belongs in this namespace: anything related to parsing code
;; and deciding what indices are involved to perform a paredit-like
;; operation.
;;
;; what does not belong here: anything related to actually performing
;; paredit-like operations in a context such as codemirror
;;
;; basically this namespace contains code that should be useful for
;; any other context which wishes to enjoy paredit-like features.
;;
;; the main idea behind the implementation here is that the code
;; contains lists of lists. any given index/position in the code is
;; contained by a list (or by an imaginary outer list that surrounds
;; the entire file). so to perform paredit operations you want to go
;; from knowing where you are (index) to knowing what's the index for
;; the relevant opening delimiter, where's the matching closing
;; delimiter, and where do your siblings (either tokens or lists
;; themseles) start and end.
;;
;; for the paredit operations currently supported, the info above is
;; sufficient.
;;
;; subpar.core is another namespace. it knows how to tell codemirror
;; what to do. it can call this code. but this code should never call
;; subpar.core. this code should have nothing to do with codemirror.
;;
;; subpar.js should call subpar.core and should know nothing about
;; what's in here.
;;
;; this code assumes clojure-like syntax, and only handles
;; single-character delimiters. for example, it does not handle ^:{

;; ***************************************************************************
;;
;; i came up with a more workable arrangement, compared to the 'parse'
;; that's currently being used.  one problem with the existing 'parse'
;; is that it is a huge loop expression with many MANY cases. it's
;; unmaintainable code.
;;
;; a second problem with the existing 'parse' is that we parse the
;; whole file on every edit. this is slow enough to prohibit use on
;; larger files.
;;
;; the better arrangement is in the other files in this directory: better.cljs
;; and macros.cljc. benefits: [1] the parsing concepts are NAMED so you're no
;; longer forced to think about what a bit of code represents. [2] there's a
;; clear distinction between peeking at the next character to determine what
;; kind of step to take, and actually consuming that next character with the
;; right transition -- thus forming a finite state machine. [3] we can now hand
;; the chunk of the previous parse result which precedes an edited section and
;; the section itself to do an incremental parse instead of having to parse the
;; whole file.
;;
;; the result from using this better parse has a different structure. so either
;; the using code or this structure needs to be tweaked.
